# Natural Japanese Translation & Tutoring
[牧田梓 Azusa Makita](mailto:smiley.azusa@gmail.com)

### Translation services
'Kotodama' is what I always have in my mind while talking, writing or expressing anything with words. 'Koto' refers to words or language, and 'dama' refers to a spirit, soul or power. It means every word has a spirit, and this spirit can affect your environment, body, mind, soul and life. Let me share my belief about the Japanese language and give a soul to your work through my translation.

Nihongo (Japanese) is a fun and unique language and I'll breathe that into the translation of any website, document, marketing copy, e-mail or personal text, turning them into fluent and professional Japanese, committed to the original tone and meaning.

### Tutoring services
Karaoke, Bonsai, Tsunami, Manga, Kawaii... you hear those words everywhere these days. Japanese words are very simple and easy to pronounce. We have three special alphabets called Hiragana ( <span class="japanese">ひらがな ), Katakana ( <span class="japanese">カタカナ ) and Kanji ( <span class="japanese">漢字 ) to spice things up!

Teaching has been my passion for years, and I make 'having fun' is the most important part. The more you like something, the more you'll learn about it. Trust me, it's very true.

> The more you like something, the more you'll learn about it.

I believe teaching is learning too. I educate both beginners and masters, for personal education, preparing for your first trip to Japan, any Japanese school assignments, or just brushing up on your Japanese skills.

Japanese culture is very different and interesting. We might say "I'm sorry" and it can mean "thank you" because it means "I'm sorry about having you do me a favor, and I thank you for it". This shows the humbleness and thoughtfulness of Japanese. To learn a language is to learn a culture, as it gives you a deeper understanding.

Feel free to have a [chat](mailto:smiley.azusa@gmail.com) with me about your needs and interests, and we'll start from there.

> While under the wing of Azusa learning the Japanese language, I found it easy to get started with how she sets out her classes. From the beginning Azusa goes through the basics and is determined you get your pronunciation right, with love of course. She is very determined to see her students progress with ease and makes learning Japanese fun.
